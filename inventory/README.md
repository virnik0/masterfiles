# CFEngine 3 inventory modules

The CFEngine 3 inventory modules are pieces of CFEngine policy that
are loaded and used by the `promises.cf` mechanism in order to
*inventory* the system.

CFEngine Enterprise has specific functionality to show and use
inventory data, but users of the Community Version can use them as
well locally on each host.

The documentation for the inventory system, highly recommended, is at
